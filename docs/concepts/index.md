# Getting Started

**JS Agent is a composable and extensible framework for creating agents with JavaScript and TypeScript.** It provides many functions for working with language models, vector stores, data loaders, and more.

While creating an agent prototype is easy, increasing its reliability and robustness is complex and requires considerable experimentation.
JS Agent provides robust building blocks and tooling to help you develop rock-solid agents faster.

**JS Agent is currently in its initial experimental phase. Before reaching version 0.1, there may breaking changes in each release.**

## Installing JS Agent

```bash
npm install js-agent
```

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18 or above
- [OpenAI API access](https://platform.openai.com/overview)
  - We'll add support for other model providers.
